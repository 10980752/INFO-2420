<h2>Questions</h2>

<ol>
	<li>What was your first impression of this site?</li>

	<li> How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
	on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>

	<li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>

	<li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from
	it? Why?</li>

	<li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
	reasonable?</li>

	<li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or
	image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li>

	<li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the
	navigation well done?</li>

	<li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
	the pages?</li>

	<li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li>

	<li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li>

<h2>Website Critique - Sabltine</h2>
<h4><a href= "https://sabletine.com/savoury.html">www.sabletine.com</a></h4>

	<li>My first impression of this site was that it looked like a modern and easy-to-navigate design.</li>
	<li>They have the name on the top left and a link to their online store on the top right, 
	there is a big picture in the middle and right above that they have the links to different types 
	of pastries such as cake, bread, macarons, etc.</li>
	<li>In general the structure makes sense, but because of how short the pages look and the fact that
	there is no color change at the end of the page it looks incomplete to me, like I just need to keep 
	scrolling to find the end.</li>
	<li>I think that in some ways it enhances it and in other ways it detracts from it, it looks good 
	with the coloring and the pictures, but I think that the cursive font and the graininess dates the 
	website some.</li>
	<li>It loaded instantaneously, which I would say is pretty reasonable.</li>
	<li>Yes, the text size and color was readable and the background color and images added to the site.</li>
	<li>The site did have a navigation bar that I think worked very well.</li>
	<li>The site did have the same background color and font throughout.</li>
	<li>It does ok with smaller window sizes, although it does look a little cramped when you go to a 
	smaller size, and I would prefer that the whole thing just shrink rather than having to scroll side to side.</li>
	<li>I like that on this site there is a side note on every photo telling you what the photo is depicting.</li>
